## Purpose
View the app [HERE](https://primary-predictions2020.appspot.com/)

We aimed to use the 2020 Democratic primary results up to Super Tuesday to predict the winner of the county level for the remaining states. So far, we have predicted 78% of the states correctly.

## Improvements
* Our model is clearly hindered by not accounting for the current delegate count for each candidate and the momentum those provide.
* Section shortcuts would help with the navigation of the app
