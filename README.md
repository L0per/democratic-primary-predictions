# Purpose

We aimed to use the 2020 Democratic primary results up to Super Tuesday to predict the winner of the county level for the remaining states. So far, we have predicted 78% of the states correctly, but our model is clearly hindered by the fact that we are not accounting for the current delegate count for each candidate and the momentum those provide.
